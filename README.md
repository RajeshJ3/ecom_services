# eCommerce Store, inspired by 'GCP Microserves demo' | Redis Hackathon Submission

## Description

Infinite Blob is a cloud-first microservices demo application. The application is a web-based e-commerce store where users can browse digital items, add them to the cart, and purchase them. Backgrounds tasks like processing payments, invoice generation and sending emails are also there in the project.

It consists of 10-tier microservices. That are performing various tasks.

Inspired By [GCP Microserves demo](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/microservices-demo), this project is using similar architecture as GCP Microserves demo, but trying to use as much as Redis features as possible.

Services like, Invoice Generation and Sending Emails are completely Event Driven, using Redis' Pub/Sub Feature.

This Project is using the following features of Redis

- Storing Data in database with the help of `JSONModels` ✅
- Ads and Recommendation Engines are using features like `Querying and indexing` ✅
- Background Tasks like Generating Invoice and Sending Emails are using `Pub/Sub features` ✅

# Overview video (Optional)

Here's a short video that explains the project and how it uses Redis:

## Architecture

**Infinite Blob** is composed of 10 microservices written in python.

## How it works

### How the data is stored:

- There are different ways, in which the data is been saved in the system.

  - In Database Models

    Using redis-om python client to create models.

    > Product Model

    ```python
    class Product(JsonModel, BaseModel):
        '''
        This model represents a single product
        '''
        # product basic info
        name: str = Field(index=True)
        description: Optional[str]

        # media
        thumbnail_url: str
        image_url: str

        # amount
        price: PositiveFloat = Field(index=True)

        # metadata
        tags: List[str] = Field(index=True)

        # analytics
        downloads: PositiveInt = Field(default=1)
    ```

    > Customer and Order Models

    ```python
    class Customer(EmbeddedJsonModel):
        '''
        This model represents a customer
        '''

        first_name: str
        last_name: str
        email: str


    class Order(JsonModel):
        '''
        This model represents a single order and it's embedded items
        '''
        # for authentication
        token: str = Field(index=True)

        # order details
        order_items: List[str]
        # init, pending, completed, cancelled
        status: str = Field(index=True, default="init")

        # customer
        customer: Optional[Customer]

        # other
        invoice_url: Optional[str]
    ```

    To save an instance of a Model the following way is used.

    > To save a Product instance sent via FastAPI request.

    ```python
    @app.post("/")
        async def products(product: Product):
            return product.save()
    ```

  - Sharing data between services using Pub/Sub

    Using instance of data models itself, we can construct the payload.

    ```python
    def publish(data, channel) -> None:
        '''
        Publish message to a particular channel
        '''
        resp = redis_db.publish(channel, json.dumps(data))
        print(f"Published to {channel}, now #{resp} message(s) pending.")


    channel = "payment"
    data = {"order": order.dict()} # order is instance of Order Model
    publish(data, channel)
    ```

### How the data is accessed:

- There are different ways, in which the data can be accessed in the system.

  - From Database Models

    > This is how to access all the products in a system, and return as FastAPI Response.

    ```python
      @app.get("/")
      async def all_products():
          all_pks = Product.all_pks()
          return [Product.get(pk) for pk in all_pks]
    ```

  - Revieving data from other service using Pub/Sub

    ```python
    def subscribe(channel, handler_function, *args, **kwargs):
        '''
        Subscribe to a channel to get messages.
        '''
        pubsub = redis_db.pubsub()
        pubsub.subscribe(channel)

        for index, message in enumerate(pubsub.listen()):
            if not index: continue

            data = message["data"]
            try: handler_function(json.loads(data), *args, **kwargs)
            except json.JSONDecodeError as e: print("[JSONDecodeError]", str(e))
            except Exception as e: print("[Exception]", str(e))


      # handle incoming message
      def handle_invoice(data: Order, *args, **kwargs): ...

      subscribe("invoice", handle_invoice)
    ```

### Performance Benchmarks

[If you migrated an existing app to use Redis, please put performance benchmarks here to show the performance improvements.]

## How to run it locally?

**Step 1.** Clone the repository

```sh
$ git clone git@github.com:RajeshJ3/ecom_services.git
$ cd ecom_services
$ git submodule init
$ git submodule update
```

**Step 2.** create a `.env` file

```sh
$ nano .env # save the following credentials into .env file
```

> If you want to use local redis docker container

```.env
REDIS_OM_URL=redis://redis:6379
```

> If you want to use redis cloud

```.env
REDIS_OM_URL=redis://<user>:<password>@<host>:<port>
```

In this case you may also remove the `redis` service and dependency from `docker-compose.yaml` file.

### Prerequisites

- Git
- Docker & docker compose
- A redis cloud account (optionally)

### Local installation

Already described in **How to run it locally?** section.

## Deployment

The project supports deployment of the backend into kubernetes.

```sh
$ kubectl create secret generic credentials --from-env-file .env
...

$ kubectl apply -f k8s/deployment.yaml
...
```

### Netlify

Click [here](https://infinite-blobs.netlify.app) to access the basic deployed version of the web-app.

It makes request to `http://127.0.0.1:8080`, so make sure that you have the backend up and running on port `8080`.

The frontend supports deployment into netlify, you can update the BASE_URL of API end-point and deploy your version of the frontend on netlify.
